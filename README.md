# AI for Detecting Anomalous Logins in Cloud Environments

This project aims to detect and simulate LT distribution line breaks using software,
leveraging PMU (Phasor Measurement Unit) data and waveform datasets.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Data Collection and Ingestion
- [ ] Data Preprocessing and Feature Extraction
- [ ] Real-Time Anomaly Detection Model
- [ ] Alert & Feedback System in Real-Time
- [ ] Monitoring & Model Retraining
